TimeLogger
==================
A program logging your activities on your computer, written in Nim, still in process.

Only available on Windows Vista or higher at this moment.

This project is inspired by ManicTime, and aims at resolving performance issues in .NET Framework and SQL Server Compact.

The recorded activity will be logged into a MySQL database, it will also support a remote server in the future.

A record viewer is still under work, there's still a long way to go.

Python scripts for migrating ManicTime data are available.

Dependency
